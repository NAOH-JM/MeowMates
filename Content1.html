                            to the family, you may want to consider adopting a pair of kittens and this is why.</h1>
                            <p>Despite what most people believe cats aren’t totally independent and in do
                            We recommend adopting two kittens at the same time and occasionally we will have a bond
                            ed litter pair or a pair we have placed together that you will see interacting with each
                            other which includes playing, sleeping and grooming each other. Having two kittens in your
                            home will keep each other entertained playing and chasing each other along with company when 
                            left alone and they will both have a snuggle buddy when sleeping home alone and will most 
                            likely keep out of trouble and offer 
                            you hours of entertainment and laughter when in your presence.

                            <p>Kittens are very intelligent animals and curious by nature
                                and will learn a lot from each other’s experiences and
                                 curiosity which can lead to a good few laughs.
        
                               (Accordingly, if one kitten quickly learns his/her good behaviours, 
                               the other is likely to follow suit—much faster than they would’ve 
                               learned on their own.)

                            <p>It’s important to keep kittens active and engaged to avoid bad behaviour 
                                out of boredom when left alone or lack of mental stimulation , even the
                                 most dedicated fur parent may not be able to provide hours to dedicated
                                  playtime.
        
                                That’s where a second kitten comes in. Playtime between two kittens will
                                 keep them exercised, active, and mentally stimulated, so you can sit back,
                                  relax, and enjoy the kitty antics.

                        <h1>Fussy eaters</h1>
                            <p>Fussy eaters can be quite frustrating and challenging, but having two kittens
                                 can make mealtimes a lot easier and more fun. When one kitten shows interest
                                  in a particular food, the other is often encouraged to try it too. Their natural
                                   curiosity and playful competition can turn feeding time into a positive and engaging
                                    experience. Plus, watching them eat together not only builds their bond but also reassures 
                                    you that they’re both getting the nutrition they need. Having a buddy around can also help 
                                    reduce stress and anxiety during meals, making them more likely to explore new flavors and 
                                    textures.

                        <h1>Give two kittens a loving home instead of one</h1>
                            <p>One of the strongest arguments for adopting two cats, rather than one, 
                                is simple: If you adopt two cats, you’re saving two lives.
                                
                                Despite the fact that kittens are more likely to be adopted, 
                                not every kitten finds her fur-ever home right  away which can lead to
                                 spending a long time in a shelter environment and decreasing the chances 
                                 of being adopted, also owning two kittens isn’t much more expensive then 
                                 owning one, sometimes even three.
                                
                                If your looking to adopt a cat or kitten or a two, speak to the lovely 
                                staff at BARC and we can assist you in finding a suitable cat or two to 
                                enjoy a loving home and provide you with years of love and laughter.

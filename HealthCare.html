                    <br>
                    To help your cat live their best feline life, Los Angeles veterinarian <b>Jeff Werber</b> (who has eight cats himself) offers helpful advice to pet parents.
                    <i>"It's crucial to get off on the right foot with cat care, "</i> he says. <b class="HighlightedWords"><i>"Good daily habits are where it starts."</i></b> These tips can help you provide the love

                    Brushing or combing your cat daily helps minimize hairball formation in the digestive tract and prevents mats and tangles, especially in long-haired breeds. 
                    While cats groom themselves often, pet owners can assist by regularly removing loose hair through brushing.

                    <p class = "Paragraph2">
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unlike dogs, cats are <b class="HighlightedWords">obligate carnivores</b>, meaning they rely on meat as the foundation of their diets. 
                        The main meal of the day should always be meat, says Werber. He cautions that exclusively feeding <b class="HighlightedWords">dry food diets</b> to cats may cause 
                        them to consume too many carbohydrates, which can be unhealthy in large amounts. "We see cats developing <b class="HighlightedWords">type II diabetes and growing obese</b> from too much dry food," Werber explains. <br>
                        <br>
                        If you have both dogs and cats, you can't feed them the same. <b class="HighlightedWords">Dog food is not good for cats</b>, nor can a cat metabolize carbs the way
                         a dog can. Consider feeding wet food as a part, if not all, of your cat's diet.</p>

                            Domestic cats evolved from desert-dwelling ancestors, so they naturally drink less water than dogs. They get most of their hydration from food,
                            with wild prey like mice containing about 70% water. Canned food offers similar hydration at 78%, while dry food contains only 5% to 10%.

                    <p class="Paragraph">
                        Regardless of their diet, always ensure your cat has <b class="HighlightedWords">access to fresh water</b>. Cats on a primarily dry food diet may drink more water to compensate. 
                        Seniors, nursing mothers, and cats with chronic health issues are more susceptible to dehydration, so monitor them closely for signs such as sunken eyes, lethargy, or panting.

                        <p class = "Paragraph2">
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As far as potty places go, Werber says a good rule of thumb is to <i class ="HighlightedWords">have one litter box per kitty, plus an additional one</i>. So if you have three cats,
                             you should set up four boxes, and you'll want to think carefully about where those boxes go. Humans tend to want the boxes tucked away in a hidden spot like a basement or dark corner, 
                             but some cats are uncomfortable in these areas. . <br>
                            <br>
                            Werber says to think about a cat's natural instincts. <i class ="HighlightedWords">"The animal is in a vulnerable position when performing those functions,"</i> he says. 
                            "They want to be able to see around them." For the same reason, your pet may not be willing to use a box with a cover or one that's been cleverly hidden in furniture.</p>

                                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Few things frustrate cat owners more than <i class ="HighlightedWords">finding their cat has peed outside the litter box</i>, especially on furniture like the couch or bed. 
                                    Why does this happen? According to Werber, there are many possible reasons, and the first step is ruling out illness. A vet visit can help identify issues like a urinary
                                     tract infection or other health concerns.

                                once or twice daily—more often if you have multiple cats. Consider relocating the litter box to a quieter, more accessible spot, away from noisy appliances or disturbances.

                                <p class = "Paragraph2">
                                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Many veterinary practices see multiple species, including canines. This can be scary for a cat who has to sit in a waiting room surrounded by dogs. 
                                    <i class ="HighlightedWords">"Look for a vet who has separate waiting areas for cats and dogs,"</i> says <b>Werber</b>. While that's ideal, not all practices have the space for this. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    If your favorite vet doesn't have two waiting rooms, ask to be called into the exam room quickly, Werber advises. You can also look for cat-only
                                     veterinarians in your area (yes, they exist!) so your kitty won't get bombarded with the sights, sounds, and smells of dogs, birds, and other critters.</p>

                                        Werber suggests accepting these "gifts" with grace, even if it’s something unpleasant like a decapitated mouse or a half-eaten bird. 
                                        While it might feel a little gross, it’s actually a sign of your cat’s affection and trust.

                                        These behaviors are your cat’s way of showing affection and marking you as their own. Take a moment to enjoy these gestures, knowing they’re offering their love in their own special way.
